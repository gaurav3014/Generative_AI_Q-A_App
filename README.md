#Setup Fake OpenAI Server
To simulate OpenAI's functionality since my open API key creation is over, I have set up a fake server. Follow these steps:

Clone the FakeServer GitHub repository.
1. git clone https://github.com/nicknochnack/FakeServer

From here you can run:
        ``` bash
        Streamlight run qeustion_ansewr.py       
        ```
